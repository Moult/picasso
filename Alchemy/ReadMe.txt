Alchemy 
ALPHA 004







ABOUT --------------------------------


Alchemy is an open drawing project aimed at exploring how we can sketch, 

draw, and create on computers in new ways. Alchemy isn't software for 

creating finished artwork, but rather a sketching environment that focuses 

on the absolute initial stage of the creation process. Experimental in nature, 

Alchemy lets you brainstorm visually to explore an expanded range of ideas 

and possibilities in a serendipitous way.





INSTALLATION -------------------------


Simply copy the Alchemy folder to wherever you keep your applications.

The 'modules' (and the 'lib' folder on Windows) folder must remain together 

with the application. Individual modules can be removed if not required, 

however be sure to not mix older modules with newer versions or vice versa.
