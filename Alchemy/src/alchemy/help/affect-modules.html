        <h1>Affect Modules</h1>
        
        <h4>Mirror</h4>
        <p>
            The Mirror module reflects shapes along a vertical and/or horizontal axis
            in real time. 
            Use the 'Horizontal' and 'Vertical' buttons to turn mirroring on and off.
            Use the 'Move' button to set the location of mirroring.
            Use the 'Reset' button to reset the location of mirroring to the
            middle of the canvas.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Blindness</h4>
        <p>
            Drawing 'blind' is an exercise used in conventional drawing, and is
            implemented here in the Blindness module by stopping the canvas 
            display being updated.
            Update the canvas display using the 'Redraw' button.
            Allow the automatic redrawing of shapes each time the pen is lifted
            by toggling the 'Autoredraw' button.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Random</h4>
        <p>
            The Random module allows you to distort and change shapes. 
            When rolling over a shape, the area around the mouse will have its
            points randomised.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mic Expand</h4>
        <p>
            The Mic Expand module uses sounds from the microphone to expand, contort, and
            change shapes. When rolling over a shape, the microphone is opened 
            and the shape is changed according to the incoming sound wave.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Repeat</h4>
        <p>
            The Repeat module duplicates shapes on rollover. This module can be
            used in combination with other affect modules such as 'Random' and
            'Mic Expands' to create slightly different shapes in multiple.
            Use the 'Repeat Interval' slider to change the rate at which shapes
            are duplicated. A smaller interval produces more shapes.
