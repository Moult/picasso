        <h1>Alchemy Toolbar</h1>
        <p>
            The Alchemy toolbar is hidden automatically and can be displayed 
            by moving the cursor into the top area of the canvas. The idea being
            to remove as much distraction as possible from the creative process.

        <ul>
            <li>Style
                <p>Toggle between drawing with a line or solid fill.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Clear
                <p>Clear the entire Alchemy canvas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Line Weight
                <p>Increase/Decrease the line weight.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Black/White
                <p>Toggle between black and white</p>
            </li>
            <li>Transparency
                <p>Adjust the transparency</p>
            </li>
            <li>Create
                <p>
                    The create dropdown menu contains all of the currently loaded 
                    'create' modules. Create modules construct shapes in some way, either
                    generatively or with user input from the cursor. Only one create
                    module can be active at a time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Affect
                <p>
                    The affect dropdown menu contains all of the currently loaded 
                    'affect' modules. Affect modules change existing shapes or alter
                    the drawing environment in some way. Multiple affect modules
                    can be selected and may cause unpredictable results 
                    (that is a good thing!).
                </p>
