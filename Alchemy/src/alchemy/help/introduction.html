        <h1>Alchemy</h1>
         <h4> Introduction </h4>
        <p>Alchemy is an open drawing project aimed at exploring how we can sketch, draw, and create on computers in new ways. Alchemy isn't software for creating finished artwork, but rather a sketching environment that focuses on the absolute initial stage of the creation process. Experimental in nature, Alchemy lets you brainstorm visually to explore an expanded range of ideas and possibilities in a serendipitous way.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Interaction</h4>
        <p>The Alchemy drawing canvas has an intentionally reduced level of functionality. No colour, no undo, no selecting or editing. Interaction focuses instead on the output of a great number of good, bad, strange and beautiful shapes.</p>
        
        <p>Alchemy consists of a growing number of 'modules' that can be added or removed at will. Other global features place focus on the 'process' of drawing, as opposed to the development of a single finished artwork.</p>
