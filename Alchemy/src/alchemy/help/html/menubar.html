        <h1>Alchemy Menubar</h1>
        <p>On Windows the Alchemy menubar is hidden automatically and can be displayed 
            by moving the cursor into the top area of the canvas. 
        On Mac OSX the menubar is displayed in the top menubar.</p>

                    </li>

                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>View
                <ul>
                    <li>Fullscreen
                        <p>Enter fullscreen mode. To exit fullscreen mode, hit the ESCAPE key.</p>
                    </li>

            <li>Session
                <p>
                    The session menu controls how a Alchemy 'session' is recorded.
                    Unlike the normal export comman the session menu creates a multi-page
                    PDF file with pages saved either automatically or at timed intervals.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toggle Recording
                        <p>
                            Turn on/off recording of a session.
                            To correctly create the PDF file, the session must be
                            explicitly started as well as ended using the 
                            'Toggle Recording' menu item.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Save Page
                        <p>Manually save a page to the session PDF file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Save Page & Clear
                        <p>
                            Manually save a page to the session PDF file,
                            then clear the canvas.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Record on Startup
                        <p>
                            Begin recording a new session when Alchemy is started.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Record Interval
                        <p>
                            Set a timed interval to the save pages to the 
                            session PDF file. The default setting, Manual,
                            turns the timed interval off and will only save
                            a page with either of the 'Save Page' commands.
                            When set to a specific time, pages will be saved
                            continuously according to that time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Auto Clear Canvas
                        <p>
                            When turned on this setting will automatically
                            erase the canvas after it has been saved using the 
                            record interval.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Set Session Directory...
                        <p>
                            Set the directory where the PDF file will be saved to.
                            The file is created automatically and saved to this 
                            directory with a name such as
                            "Alchemy-2008-02-07-50-37.pdf".
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                
            </li>
            <li>Switch
                <p>
                    The switch menu allows you to quickly open the current Alchemy
                    canvas in another user-defined application. The idea is to be
                    able to quickly continue working in a more 'conventional'
                    software application without loosing the creative 'flow'.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch Vector
                        <p>
                            Open the current Alchemy canvas as a vector graphic in an
                            external application.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Switch Bitmap
                        <p>
                            Open the current Alchemy canvas as a bitmap graphic in an
                            external application.
                        </p>

                            Choose an external application to open the Alchemy
                            canvas in vector format.
