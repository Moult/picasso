        <h1>Create Modules</h1>
        
        <h4>Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Shapes module draws like a regular pen in freeform mode or straight
            lines in straight mode.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mic Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Mic Shapes module uses the sound level from your computers 
            microphone to change how shapes are created.
            In 'fatten' mode the thickness of the line is determined by the 
            microphone sound level. More noise creates a fatter line and vice versa.
            In 'shake' mode the location of the line is changed according to the
            microphone sound level. More noise creates a more 'shaken up' line.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Speed Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Speed Shapes module accentuates the pen speed to create shapes
            that throw the line beyond the actual pen position.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Trace Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Trace Shapes module downloads a random image using Flickr
            and loads it hidden behind the canvas. The pen then snaps to the 
            edges of the hidden picture, creating unknown forms.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Type Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Type Shapes module creates random shapes from type forms. It
            looks for fonts on your computer then layers and distorts them to
            create abstract shapes.
            These shapes that can be used as a starting point for characters, 
            spaceships, or whatever shape you see in the 'clouds'.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Median Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Median Shapes module draws a 'median' line between the last line
            and current line. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>X Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The X Shapes module creates hard and sharp edged shapes that move
            erratically according to the line duration and pen speed.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Inverse Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Inverse Shapes module draws like a regular pen except inverted.
            When the pen is up it draws, and when down it does not.
