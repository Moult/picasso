        <h1>Create Modules</h1>
        
        <h4>Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Shapes module draws like a regular pen in freeform mode or straight
            lines in straight mode.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Inverse Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Inverse Shapes module draws like a regular pen except inverted.
            When the pen is up it draws, and when down it does not.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Type Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Type Shapes module creates random shapes from type forms. It
            looks for fonts on your computer then layers and distorts them to
            create abstract shapes.
            These shapes that can be used as a starting point for characters, 
            spaceships, or whatever shape you see in the 'clouds'.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mic Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Mic Shapes module uses the sound level from your computers 
            microphone to change how shapes are created.
            In 'fatten' mode the thickness of the line is determined by the 
            microphone sound level. More noise creates a fatter line and vice versa.
            In 'shake' mode the location of the line is changed according to the
            microphone sound level. More noise creates a more 'shaken up' line.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Median Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            The Median Shapes module draws a 'median' line between the last line
            and current line. 
        </p>
